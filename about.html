        <h1>about me</h1>
      <p>hello there! myself aseth currently i'm a computer science student. while i am studying CS, my complete interest doesn't lie there.</p>
      <ul>
          <li> most of my interest lies in the depth of physics. however that's not all </li>
          <li> i also find myslf quite interested in subjects such as electronics and aerospace. </li>
          <li> aside from these STEM subjects, i am also interested in cinematic, philosphical and artistic stuff too. </li>
          <li> talking about my hobbies, i am not much of a hobbyist, but i do enjoy occasional reading and writing which kinda help me reflect myself. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> the main reason for creating this web is to basically share the 'knowledge' i've/will gained/gain in this journey called life? </p>
      <p>And that would be all for 'About Me' Bye ðŸ‘‹</p>
