        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello there! Myself Anurag, I am a from India currently a Computer Science student at some random institute. Even though i am studying Cs my interest doesnt completely lies there most of my interest is towards physics however saying physics is my only interest wouldn't be fair i sometimes lean towards electronic devices & aerospace too aside from these STEM subjects i am quite interested in topics like Cinematography, philosphy, art and etc; talking about my hobbies i have very few of them like occasional reading and writing. The main reason of me making this whole thing is to share the things i learn with others.</p>
      <p>And that would be all for 'About Me' Bye ðŸ‘‹</p>
