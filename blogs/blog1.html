    <h1>uncertainty of human judgments</h1>
    <article>
        <section class="blog-content">
            <p>a thought sprung up in my mind, something that often lingers when i find myself pondering the way we make decisions. it's the notion of uncertainty, how it plays such a significant role in human judgment. it’s something that can never fully be escaped, though we often try to overcome it. emotions, lack of knowledge, and external influences(and maybe more), each of these contribute to the uncertainty we feel when making decisions, and yet none can resolve it entirely.</p>
            <p>after gaining the profound knowledge of what might be right and what might not, what do we do? we judge. however, this knowledge of what is right and wrong is purely based on one's own conscience. it must be understood that this sense of conscience is not always self-developed. sometimes it is shaped by religious beliefs, and sometimes it’s influenced by external factors. So, it can be said that what we think is right cannot always be right, and the same goes for the definition of wrong. in order to know what can be most certainly right or wrong, we must try to fit into different shoes before we conclude. Things can’t be solely right or solely wrong so we must be influenced by the complexity of each situation.</p>
            <p>when we are faced with judgment, our emotions often take the front seat. it's hard to avoid the overwhelming impact our feelings can have, especially when a decision has the potential to affect us deeply. overwhelming emotions cloud our reasoning, making it difficult to see the situation with clarity. and yet, emotions alone aren’t the whole story. There’s also the undeniable presence of knowledge—or rather, the lack of it. no matter how much we learn, we never know the complete truth of any situation. we are limited by our own experiences, by the perspectives we can see, and by the sheer complexity of the world. our judgments are never certain because we can't possibly understand every factor that plays into them.</p>
            <p>then, there’s the influence of the world around us. society, culture, the people in our lives—all of these shape how we think and, by extension, how we judge. Before making a decision, we often wonder how it will be perceived, what others might think of us, or what the wider world’s reaction could be. in this way, external pressures complicate the already uncertain process of judgment.</p>
            <p>uncertainty, then, seems to be part of our nature. it is not something we can entirely overcome, because evolution has not equipped us with a mind that can always perceive every angle or foresee every outcome. we might feel certain about a task or decision in the moment, but there’s always the possibility that something beyond our control will shift the course of events.</p>
            <p>ultimately, uncertainty cannot be completely eliminated, but we can reduce its hold on us. knowledge is key to mitigating its influence. By being more judgmental—considering multiple viewpoints and trying to see things from different perspectives—we can reduce the uncertainty we feel in our decisions. yet even with this, we cannot fully escape it. it is, at the end of the day, a fundamental part of being human. We can try to manage it, but it will always remain, quietly present in the background of every choice we make.</p>
